# Model Evaluation State

Date: 2026-05-26

## Purpose

This repo separates model evidence into three lanes so the main benchmark table
does not mix fully comparable ASR runs with exploratory or runtime-blocked
candidates.

## FIRST PRINCIPLE Decision

The bottleneck is not "more model names." The bottleneck is a layered
benchmark pipeline:

```text
1-row smoke
-> 15-row gate
-> Taiwan Traditional Chinese locale gate
-> 258-row comparable split
-> selected-300 CDS-ASR gate
-> high-stakes 300 paper-facing evidence
```

A model can move forward only when the previous gate has aggregate evidence.
Raw predictions, transcripts, selected row content, model weights, and
transcript-bearing runtime logs remain local or ignored.

## Lane 1: Main Benchmark Table

Only these models currently have comparable large-split evidence suitable for
the main ASR benchmark table:

| Model / run family | Status | Use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Whisper small | completed comparable split evidence | main comparison |
| Whisper large-v2 | completed comparable split evidence | main comparison |
| Breeze-ASR-25 base | completed comparable split evidence | main comparison |
| Breeze-ASR-25 LoRA legacy best | completed comparable split evidence | main comparison / legacy contrast |
| Breeze-ASR-25 partial encoder legacy best | completed comparable split evidence | main comparison / current ASR hypothesis candidate |
| Breeze-ASR-26 | completed comparable split evidence | main comparison |

These models can appear together in the main table because they have passed the
repo's contract for comparable aggregate metrics, runtime records, and locale
reporting.

## Lane 2: Candidate / Exploratory ASR

These models are tracked, but they must not enter the main table until they
pass the promotion gates in order.

| Model | Current evidence | Current decision |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Whisper large-v3 | 15-row gate exists; locale not clean | do not promote to 258-row or selected-300 |
| Whisper large-v3-turbo | 15-row gate exists; locale not clean | speed/quality feasibility only |
| FunASR SenseVoiceSmall | 1-row and 15-row gates exist; strict locale failed | reject from full split until locale policy changes |
| Qwen3-ASR-0.6B | 1-row and 15-row gates exist; strict locale failed | reject from full split until locale policy changes |
| Qwen3-ASR-1.7B | runtime gate only; timeout before inference | retry only after isolated cache/download plan |

The 15-row gates are useful negative evidence. They do not justify full-split
promotion while raw output violates the Taiwan Traditional Chinese locale gate.

## Lane 3: Multimodal Runtime-Blocked

Gemma 4 E2B/E4B are tracked as prompted multimodal-audio candidates, not as pure
ASR baselines.

| Model | Current evidence | Current decision |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `unsloth/gemma-4-E2B` | local runtime class/config probe only | blocked until isolated Gemma 4 multimodal runtime |
| `unsloth/gemma-4-E4B` | local runtime class/config probe only | blocked until isolated Gemma 4 multimodal runtime |

These models must not be mixed into pure ASR baseline tables. If they become
runnable, they should be reported as a separate prompted multimodal-audio lane
with prompt, audio length, decoding, runtime, hallucination, repetition,
timestamp/speaker-label, and locale checks.

## Promotion Requirements

A model can move from candidate lane to the next larger gate only if all of
these are true:

| Requirement | Minimum gate |
| --- | --- |
| Valid output rows | `>= 95%` expected rows emitted |
| Taiwan Traditional Chinese locale | simplified-character rate `0`, locale-violation row rate `<= 1%` |
| Translation control | no English-only output for Chinese reference rows |
| Hallucination control | no invented speaker labels or timestamps unless the runner is explicitly a timestamp task |
| Runtime record | wall time, seconds per row, rows per second, device, dtype, toolkit, backend, cuDNN/attention settings |
| Reproducibility | model id, revision/commit hash, package versions, command, input split, output schema |
| Metric policy | `cer_zh_micro` primary; `wer_zh_jieba_micro` supplemental; no Traditional/Simplified conversion inside raw metric scoring |

Post-decode OpenCC or other conversion can be evaluated only as a deployment
repair lane. It cannot be used to claim the raw ASR model passed the locale
gate.

## Reporting Language

English:

```text
We separate models into three evaluation states: completed comparable ASR
benchmarks, candidate models passing only small-scale gates, and
runtime-blocked exploratory multimodal models. Only the first group is included
in the main comparative table. Candidate models are not escalated to 258-row,
selected-300, or high-stakes 300 evaluation unless they pass runtime validity
and Taiwan Traditional Chinese locale gates.
```

Traditional Chinese:

```text
本研究將模型分為三層：已完成主要可比較測試、僅完成小規模 gate 的候選模型、
以及尚受 runtime 限制而未形成有效 inference 的探索模型。正式比較表僅納入
第一層模型。第二、三層模型必須先通過有效輸出率與台灣繁體中文 locale gate，
才可升級至 258-row、selected-300 或 high-stakes 300 評估。
```
